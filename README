GOALS FOR PLAYER CONTROL

metroid / ninja / n

* fast paced actions
* wall jumps and grabs
* ducking rolls
* grabbing ceilings
* ladders
* elevators
* double jumps
* lots of animations
* double tap dives
* prone
* mirror's edge!!!

don't try to be too realistic, make it really fun!

wall jumps:
    find if collision is on side of wall
    if wall has a high friction
        if player is pressing away from the wall
            apply horizontal force against wall
            ( this will effectively press player and stick to wall )
        if player jumps, allow for a 45 angle jump away from wall
