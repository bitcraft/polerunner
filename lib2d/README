Lib2d is a game engine that I have been developing to create PyWeek games.  It is poorly documented, awkward, and probably not usable.

What it does do is:
	State (context) management
	Animated Sprites with multiple animations and automatic flipping
	TMX level importing
	Basic GUI features
	Physics simulation (pure python)
